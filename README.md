Gazebo simulation + Raspberry Pi mapping code for pothole detection prototype

# Pothole Detection and Mapping System

**Project:** Pothole detection (Gazebo simulation) and room mapping (Raspberry Pi).

## Overview
This repository contains:
- Gazebo simulation demonstrating autonomous behavior and pothole mapping.
- Raspberry Pi mapping code used to map a room (sample data included).

## Current Status
- Gazebo simulation: WORKING ✅
- Room mapping on Raspberry Pi: WORKING ✅
- Laser-based pothole detection: UNDER DEVELOPMENT ⚙️

## How to Run (simulation)
1. Launch Gazebo with the provided world and launch files.
2. Run the controller script in `Gazebo_Simulation/`.

## Raspberry Pi Mapping
- Run `mapping.odt` on Raspberry Pi (details in comments inside the script).

## Future Work
Integrate laser-based pothole detection and cloud upload to send pothole data to:
- Public Works Department (PWD) for maintenance.
- ADAS-enabled vehicles for real-time driver alerts.
